## Hey!

I'm a Software Engineer from Lakeland, Florida.

I love making cool stuff with code, and I'm constantly teaching myself new things!

## My Story

While growing up, video games, computers, and the internet fascinated me endlessly. I always found learning to be fun and performed well in school. In middle school, I had my first computer classes (and robotics club), gaining experience with Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop and InDesign, and even making basic web pages with HTML.

During high school, I volunteered at my elementary school's art club and continued with computer classes, eventually presenting a graphics design project in front of a panel as part of Future Business Leaders of America. Thanks to the dual enrollment program, I graduated high school Summa Cum Laude with an A.A. degree from Polk State College in 2021.

The following semester, I started at Florida Polytechnic University where I had the pleasure of creating games with the Media Club and as part of my concentration, winning first place at the university Game Expo. My senior project had me collaborate with NASA and Florida Space Institute to create a prototype Mars RE-RASSOR rover, for which I built the simulation. I graduated from Florida Poly in 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and entered the job market.

Currently, I'm pursuing work as a Software Engineer while doing freelance AI training and teaching myself with personal projects to expand my resume and skills.
